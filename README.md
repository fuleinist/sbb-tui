## ❓Why

> I often work in the train, passing through remote regions of Switzerland where I'll have to wait up to an entire minute to finally be able to load the SBB website/app and get the much needed information about my next connection (I have a cheap cellular data subscription). Someday I fell onto the incredible [Swiss public transport API](https://transport.opendata.ch/docs.html) and decided it was the perfect occasion to learn how to create TUIs.

## 📝 TODO

- [ ] **Stationboard** mode, returns a list of the next departures at a specific station.
- [ ] Connection warnings
- [ ] Better keymaps/navigation logic
- [ ] Better keymap help
- [ ] Suggestions when writing strings without accent (writing "zurich", "Zürich" isn't suggested)
- [ ] Revise UI for not-so-wide terminals
- [ ] Scroll icons as hint in border of scrollable detailedRender window
- [ ] Only autocomplete with cursor at last character, otherwise move cursor right
- [ ] Shorten date/time fields by one character length by either extending cursor placement to character before right border, or by removing cursor when finished at end of input CharLimit
